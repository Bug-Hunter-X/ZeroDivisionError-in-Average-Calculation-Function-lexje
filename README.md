This repository demonstrates a common Python coding error: a `ZeroDivisionError` that occurs when calculating the average of an empty list. The `bug.py` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.py` provides a corrected version that gracefully handles the edge case of an empty input list. This example showcases the importance of handling potential exceptions in your code to prevent unexpected crashes.
